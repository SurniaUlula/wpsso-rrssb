= Uses the WPSSO Framework =

The WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) plugin is required to use the WPSSO RRSSB extension. You can use the Free version of WPSSO RRSSB with *both* the Free and Pro versions of WPSSO, but [WPSSO RRSSB Pro](http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/) requires the use of the [WPSSO Pro](http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/) plugin as well. [Purchase the WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons (WPSSO RRSSB) Pro extension](http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/) (includes a *No Risk 30 Day Refund Policy*).

= Proven Performance =

WPSSO and WPSSO RRSSB are *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). WPSSO loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.
