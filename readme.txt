== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-rrssb/assets/icon-256x256.png">

Add awesome **Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons** to posts / pages, custom post types, [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/), [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/), [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) product pages, and much more.</p>

Include social sharing buttons in the content, excerpt, widget, CSS sidebar, shortcodes, templates, and *admin editing pages* &mdash; share your posts and pages directly from the editor! Do you use bbPress, BuddyPress, or WooCommerce? The Pro version of WPSSO RRSSB includes special integration modules to add social sharing buttons to even more locations!

The **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) social icons** used by WPSSO RRSSB automatically resize to their container, so they always look great on any device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.), including high resolution retina displays!

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> &mdash; WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons is an extension for the WPSSO (Core Plugin), which <em>automatically</em> generates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your content for Social Media Optimization (SMO) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</p>

<p>The WPSSO RRSSB Free extension works with either the Free or Pro version of WPSSO (Core Plugin).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/?utm_source=wpssorrssb-readme-prereq">WPSSO RRSSB Pro extension</a> uses many WPSSO Pro (Core Plugin) features and requires the <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/?utm_source=wpssorrssb-readme-prereq">WPSSO Pro (Core Plugin)</a>.</p>
