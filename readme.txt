WPSSO Core extension to add Ridiculously Responsive (SVG) Social Sharing Buttons in your content, excerpts, CSS sidebar, widget, shortcode, etc.

== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-rrssb/assets/icon-256x256.png">

Add awesome **Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons** to posts / pages, custom post types, [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/), [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/), [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) product pages, and much more.</p>

Include social sharing buttons in the content, excerpt, widget, CSS sidebar, shortcodes, templates, and *admin editor page* &mdash; share your posts, pages, and custom post types directly from the admin editor page!

**Do you use bbPress, BuddyPress, or WooCommerce?** The Pro version of WPSSO RRSSB includes special integration modules to add social sharing buttons to even more locations!

The **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) social icons** used by WPSSO RRSSB automatically resize to their container, so they always look great on any device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.), including high resolution retina displays!

**WPSSO RRSSB is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

WPSSO Core and its extensions make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light.

WPSSO Core and its extensions are fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.3 or better required).

<h3>WPSSO Core Plugin Prerequisite</h3>

WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons is an extension for the WPSSO Core plugin &mdash; which creates complete &amp; accurate meta tags and Schema markup from your content for social sharing, social media / SMO, search / SEO / rich cards, and more.

The [WPSSO RRSSB Pro extension](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/?utm_source=wpssorrssb-readme-prereq) uses many WPSSO Core Pro features, which requires an active and licensed [WPSSO Core Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/?utm_source=wpssorrssb-readme-prereq).
