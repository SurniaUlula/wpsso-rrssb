= Proven Performance =

WPSSO and WPSSO RRSSB are *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). WPSSO loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= Extends the WPSSO Plugin =

The WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) plugin is required to use the WPSSO RRSSB extension.

Use the Free version of WPSSO RRSSB with *both* the Free and Pro versions of WPSSO. The [WPSSO RRSSB Pro extension](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/?utm_source=wpssorrssb-readme-extends) (along with all WPSSO Pro extensions) requires the [WPSSO Pro plugin](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/?utm_source=wpssorrssb-readme-extends) as well.
